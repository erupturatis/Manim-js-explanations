# Project Documentation

This project is a presentation created using Manim, a Python library for creating mathematical animations. The presentation is about JavaScript, its basics, and its uses.

## Dependencies

### Very important !!! First follow the guide on how to get started with manim on your local machine that is presented [in this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsUrbWb2D4&list=PLsMrDyoG1sZm6-jIUQCgN3BVyEVOZz3LQ) or in the official [manim](https://www.manim.community/) documentation. The videos I mentioned earlier also teach you how to use the engine.

#### Node that there are multiple version of manim and this project is using the [manim community](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) version

After installing manim locally, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed . Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:

- manim==0.7.0
- manim-slides==0.1.3

Assuming you forked / cloned this project you can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then to create the video files you can run
`manim main.py BasicExample`
And to run in presentation mode you run
`manim-slides BasicExample`

#### For more details on rendering options and on manim in general check out the videos [mentioned earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsUrbWb2D4&list=PLsMrDyoG1sZm6-jIUQCgN3BVyEVOZz3LQ)
